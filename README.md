# udownmark

`udownmark` is a very simple and small parser and renderer for a subset
of Markdown-like syntax written in Python. It is intended to be used
with small Python implementations like
[Pycopy](https://github.com/pfalcon/micropython) or MicroPython.

`udownmark` implements basic inline and block-level formatting, mostly
compatible with Markdown, and is a work-in-porgress. Exact set of
currently supported features can be seen in `tests/` directory included
in the main repository of the project.
